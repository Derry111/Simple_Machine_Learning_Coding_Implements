## Welcome to the simple coding implements of ML algorithms 
Given the popularity of optimal machine learning packages such as scikit-learn and tensorflow, one can still benefit from reconstructing the algorithms by coding within their own domain knowledge

The reasons for reinventing the wheel are:
* Gain better insights into the mechanism behind the statistical model listed on the textbooks
* Strengthen extendable coding skills with Python/C++ and makes it possible to understand the source code of open-source packages
* Enjoy the community collaboration of coding especially for the novices who have just set off exploring on Github
